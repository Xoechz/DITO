\section{Motivation}

\subsection{TO BE DELETED: NOTES}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Current State of OTEL and a future of very probable mass adoption(with citations)
	\item OTEL not only in Microservices, but all distributed systems. Company wide observability
	\item Transition to the problem, mentioning services which transfer a lot of data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ACTUAL TEXT}

OpenTelemetry has established itself as a groundbreaking new standard in the world of observability.
It is replacing many vendor specific solutions with a single, standardized, extensible, open source
and language integrated solution.

\section{Problem}

\subsection{TO BE DELETED: NOTES}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fractured company software systems with multiple sources of truth.
	\item Merging and transferring data across multiple systems.
	\item Inconsistent data
	\item Notifying admins of the different single systems about data quality.
	\item Concrete Problem - try to explain swietelsky hell
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}

\subsection{TO BE DELETED: NOTES}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain Traces and Metrics in the context of OpenTelemetry.
	\item Explain Collectors, their use, components and different types of Collectors.
	\item Write a Collector in GO and generate traces in a .NET Application to
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Provide an overview over the data quality in the system.
		      \item See where errors are happening and what their source could be.
		      \item Have traces for every data point travelling through a system, next to the traces per job execution.
		      \item Metrics which are able to be grouped by source, destination, entity being synced, job or machine executing the job.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item do that a bit more and a bit better lol
\end{itemize}
