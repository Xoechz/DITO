\chapter{Abstract}

Keeping track of distributed software systems is hard as it is, 
but when moving a large amount of data from and to multiple endpoints, 
traditional logging often fails to answer questions about data quality and program reliability.

Traces and metrics can help to mitigate these problems, but the programs
transferring the data are often implemented as independent background jobs 
using different schedules, often even on independent machines.

Luckily using OpenTelemetry you can unify traces across multiple machines easily with collectors, 
leaving only the problem of trace scope.\par

The scope of a trace is normally one request or job execution,
which makes keeping track of specific data points hard.

The focus of this thesis is fixing this problem.\par

The goal is to provide a way to collect, unify and then split traces into new traces 
showing data points travelling through a system. 

This thesis stretches from creating traces with semantic events on the job level, 
to connecting traces from different jobs working on the same data, 
then splitting and sampling these traces into multiple traces for each data point 
in an OpenTelemetry collector and finally generating metrics out of these traces to 
provide a big picture view of the data transfer.
