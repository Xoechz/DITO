\chapter{Abstract}

Keeping track of distributed software systems is already a complex task.
When large volumes of data are transferred between multiple endpoints, 
traditional logging often fails to provide answers regarding data quality and system reliability.

Traces and metrics can help to mitigate these issues, but the programs responsible for data transfer 
are often implemented as independent background jobs with varying schedules,
often even on independent machines.

Fortunately, OpenTelemetry allows for the unification of traces across multiple machines using collectors.
However, the issue of trace scope remains:
a trace typically represents a single request or job execution,
making it difficult to track specific data points.

The focus of this thesis is solving this problem.
The goal is to provide a method for collecting, unifying, and then splitting traces into
new ones that illustrate how individual data points move through the system.
The work includes generating traces with semantic events at the job level,
linking traces from different jobs that process the same data,
splitting and sampling these traces into one per data point using an OpenTelemetry collector,
and finally generating metrics from these traces to provide a big picture view of data transfer.
